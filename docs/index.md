# Welcome!

These pages will walk you through embedding the FileThis web components into your website. With very little coding on your part, you can present your users with a UI that provides a simple workflow for collecting documents —from their online accounts— and then delivering them to your service on your users' behalf. 

We've divided the instructions here into three steps. You can work your way through each section by clicking on the items in the table of contents to the left, or by just clicking the "Next" button when you come to the end of each section.

In the first section, you will enter your FileThis partner API credentials into an online web application and see the web components in action.

In the second section, you will do a little coding to bring up the FileThis web components in a minimal website that you host on your development workstation.

In the final section, you'll embed the web components into your own website.
